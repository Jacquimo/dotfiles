# Dotfiles

In order to have a single look and feel for bash across all UNIX terminals, I have created this project which will automatically setup my saved dot files, so that I can quickly and easily setup my coding environment.

## Installation

Run these commands in a unix terminal to setup the project
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Jacquimo/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh
```

## Contributors
